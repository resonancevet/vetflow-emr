## The Problem

The veterinary PIMS market is broken — and everyone knows it.

**For clinics:** Commercial systems like ezyVet, ProVet Cloud, and Cornerstone charge $200–600+/month, lock you into proprietary data formats, and deliver software that staff describe as "extremely nonuser friendly," "very clunky," with "terrible" financial reporting and support that declines after the sale closes. Legacy systems crash. Modern ones charge extra for texting. Every one of them holds your data hostage.

**For innovators:** Jonathan Ayers (former IDEXX CEO) published research in February 2026 asking whether AI agents will disrupt the PIMS as the "system of record." The answer is yes — but only if there's an open system to build on. Today, most PIMS have closed or poorly documented APIs, making it nearly impossible for AI tools, voice agents, or third-party developers to read and write patient data. There is no widely adopted data interoperability standard in veterinary medicine.

**The open-source gap:** OpenVPMS is Java-based, dated, and primarily Australian-focused. A few student projects exist on GitHub but none are production-ready. Until now, there has been **no modern, well-designed, open-source PIMS with an open API.**

OpenVPM fills that gap.

## What is OpenVPM?

OpenVPM is a modern, cloud-native veterinary practice information management system that is:

- **Beautiful and intuitive** — Practice managers and front desk staff should be productive within a single shift, not a multi-week training program
- **API-first** — Every feature accessible via a documented REST + WebSocket API so AI tools, voice agents, and integrations can read AND write
- **Cloud-native but self-hostable** — Run it on our cloud or deploy it on your own infrastructure
- **Free and open source** — MIT licensed, forever. No per-provider pricing. No vendor lock-in. Your data is yours.

> *"I would need to see the product benefit us by reducing our staff hours."*
> — A practice manager we interviewed during research

That's the bar we're building to.

```

### Database Design

16 schema files covering every core entity with proper relationships, soft deletes, and multi-tenant isolation via `practice_id`:

`practices` · `locations` · `users` · `clients` · `patients` · `patient_weights` · `patient_allergies` · `appointments` · `appointment_types` · `soap_notes` · `vaccination_records` · `lab_results` · `procedures` · `prescriptions` · `invoices` · `invoice_items` · `products` · `services` · `communications` · `templates` · `controlled_substances` · `webhooks` · `api_keys` · `audit_log`

All clinical data uses typed, relational tables — not JSONB blobs. This means AI agents and integrations can query structured data directly.

### API Coverage

21 tRPC routers exposing 150+ endpoints:

`auth` · `patients` · `clients` · `appointments` · `records` · `billing` · `inventory` · `communications` · `reports` · `dashboard` · `whiteboard` · `portal` · `templates` · `controlled-substances` · `insurance` · `notifications` · `webhooks` · `settings` · `data` · `ai`

Every endpoint includes Zod validation, role-based access control, and is also available as a standard REST endpoint via trpc-openapi.

### Security

- **Multi-tenancy:** Row-level isolation via `practice_id` on every table
- **RBAC:** Four roles (Admin, Veterinarian, Technician, Front Desk) enforced at the API layer
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js with bcrypt password hashing and database sessions
- **Headers:** X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy
- **Audit:** Full audit logging of all data changes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker (for PostgreSQL and MinIO)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/evangauer/openvpm.git
cd openvpm

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# Start PostgreSQL and MinIO
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Apply database schema
pnpm db:push

# Seed with realistic demo data
pnpm db:seed

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with the demo credentials:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@neighborhoodvet.example.com | password123 |
| Veterinarian | sarah.chen@neighborhoodvet.example.com | password123 |
| Technician | jamie.torres@neighborhoodvet.example.com | password123 |
| Front Desk | morgan.bailey@neighborhoodvet.example.com | password123 |

The seed data creates a complete demo practice — "Neighborhood Veterinary" — with 8 staff, 25 clients, 40 patients, 2 weeks of appointments, SOAP notes, vaccination records, invoices, and 50 inventory products.

### Deploy with Docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The Docker setup includes PostgreSQL 16 with health checks, MinIO for S3-compatible file storage, and a multi-stage production build of the web application.

## API

OpenVPM is **API-first**. Every action the UI performs goes through the same API available to third-party integrations. This is the killer feature — no other open-source PIMS has a real, well-documented, read-write API.

### Webhooks

Subscribe to real-time events:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "events": [
    "appointment.created",
    "appointment.checked_in",
    "patient.created",
    "invoice.paid"
  ]
}
```

Payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256 and delivered with exponential backoff retry.

### API Keys

Scoped API keys with rate limiting and audit logging. Create keys via the Settings panel or the API itself.

### For AI Developers

OpenVPM's structured data models and event streams make it the ideal foundation for veterinary AI:

- **Voice agents** can book appointments, process refill requests, and complete forms via the API
- **AI scribes** can write SOAP notes directly into the medical record
- **Diagnostic AI** can read lab results, patient history, and write assessment suggestions
- **Reminder systems** can query overdue vaccinations, pending follow-ups, and automate outreach

The PIMS is the system of record. AI agents are first-class citizens.

## Why Open Source Matters for Veterinary Medicine

The veterinary industry is at a crossroads. AI is arriving. Data interoperability is becoming critical. And the dominant PIMS vendors are still charging hundreds per month for software that crashes, frustrates staff, and locks clinics into proprietary ecosystems.

Open source changes the equation:

- **Clinics own their data.** Export everything, any time. No lock-in, period.
- **The community drives the roadmap.** Features are built because practices need them, not because a sales team prioritized them.
- **AI builders can innovate.** An open API and structured data models mean the next generation of veterinary AI tools can be built on a foundation that actually works.
- **Costs go to zero.** The software is free. Forever. Invest the $200–600/month you were paying into your team instead.

We believe the best software for veterinary medicine should be built *with* the veterinary community, not sold *to* it.
